# Gesture-Motion-MiDOG
Controlling of a MiDog (small quadraped) robot using the Hand Gestures detected by a Neural Network.

A neural network is trained on the basic gestures of the hand that are linked to the actions of the robot (E.g., sit, walk forward, walk sideward, greet, etc.)> This network is then used to control the robot in real time by performing actions.
